# CKEDITOR insert accordion plugin.

Plugin was designed for Drupal 7 but you can use it as standalone CKEDITOR plugin.

# Using template to generate markup.



## Roadmap.

- Create version for Drupal 8
- Remove dependency of jQuery.
- Create a branch only for the plugin.
- Declare new templates.

## Requirements.

- CKEditor 4.4 (May work on any 4+ version.)
- jQuery 2+
- HandlebarsJS (already provided)

## Why

You users need place holders for lists or accordions?
you want to provide the HTML markup but you want to keep them from messing it up?

If yes this plugin is for you.

just ask how many items meaning (li, div, or whatever they want).

**example:**

**result:** If 3 iterations are required.
